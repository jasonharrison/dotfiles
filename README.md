This is a collection of configuration files and scripts that customize tools I use.

[`rails/.rubocop.yml`](rails/.rubocop.yml) is a configuration file intended to be used with the [rubocop-rails](https://github.com/toshimaru/rubocop-rails) gem.

[`nvim/init.vim`](nvim/init.vim) is a configuration file for [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim).
